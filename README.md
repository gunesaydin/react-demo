# React Frontend Demo

## [LiveDemo](https://gunes-react-demo.herokuapp.com)


## A quick walkthrough

I prepared two versions of this demo app. One is with Angular 7 and this one is with React.

I had not have the chance to work with Angular before this challenge. My usual go-to frontend framework for my own projects is React. That is why I wanted to prepare two versions: one with Angular as a challenge for myself and another with React as a fallback.
